This note-saving application operates on a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular 2 and NodeJS). 

## Running the application

Run `npm run build` to build the project, then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## To develop

Run `npm run devServer` to start the server, then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
Run `npm run devWeb` to start the web application (Angular), then navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

By developing this way, any saved changes will be added automatically and faster!
